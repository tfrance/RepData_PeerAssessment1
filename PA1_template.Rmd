# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1

## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
# Create a directory to store the data:
if (!file.exists("data")) {
  dir.create("data")
}

# Unzip activity.zip into the data directory:
unzip("activity.zip", exdir="./data", overwrite=T)

# Read in the data:
data = read.csv("./data/activity.csv")

```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
# Create a data structure that sums daily steps by date:
data.groupedby.date = aggregate(steps ~ date, sum, data=data)

# Histogram of total daily steps
hist(data.groupedby.date$steps)

# Calculate the mean and median of total daily steps taken
```

The mean total daily steps taken is `r mean(data.groupedby.date$steps)`.

The median total daily steps taken is `r median(data.groupedby.date$steps)`

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
